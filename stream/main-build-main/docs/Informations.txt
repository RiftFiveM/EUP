>>>>>>**MOST IMPORTANT THING**<<<<<<
    For support, request invite to our discord server from website Live chat!
    After connect to our discord, request access to our github and update your scripts from our github.
    (just replace script folders if you didn't change anything)
>>>>>>**MOST IMPORTANT THING**<<<<<<

We highly recommend run your server on Dedicated or Virtual machine with Windows OS for best performance. (gamehosting like ZAP could cause some problems)
Windows and Linux is supported, but server was mainly tested on Windows, if you want to use different OS you will have to figure out your way to make it work on other systems.
Server was tested with 64 slots.

If you didn't buy our police vehicles you have to add your own vehicle and edit the sellable vehicles in fvm-jobveshop config.
If you buy our vehicle pack then you have to add these vehicles by yourself. We dont recommend to add all vehicles due to performance issues.


Requirements for:
    - custom clothing (like EUP) require FiveM Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/fivem READ BENEFITS)
    - TokkoVOIP require only TeamSpeak 3 server
    - more slots (onesync) require FiveM Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/fivem READ BENEFITS)
